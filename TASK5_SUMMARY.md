# Task 5: Rate Limiting - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

### Objective
Implement rate limiting using Bucket4j to protect sensitive API endpoints from brute force attacks, API abuse, and denial of service.

### OWASP Vulnerability Fixed
**API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption**

Without rate limiting, attackers could:
- Launch brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- Spam registration with automated bots
- Abuse expensive operations like transfers and searches
- Cause denial of service by overwhelming the API

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Bucket4j Dependency
**File:** `pom.xml`

Added rate limiting library:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.bucket4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>bucket4j-core</artifactId>
  <version>8.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Created RateLimitingFilter
**File:** `src/main/java/edu/nu/owaspapivulnlab/config/RateLimitingFilter.java` (NEW)

Implemented servlet filter with endpoint-specific rate limits:

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `/api/auth/login` | 5/minute | Prevent brute force attacks |
| `/api/auth/signup` | 3/minute | Prevent spam registration |
| `/api/accounts/transfer` | 10/minute | Prevent transaction abuse |
| `/api/users/search` | 20/minute | Prevent expensive query abuse |
| Other endpoints | 100/minute | General protection |

**Key Features:**
- IP-based rate limiting (separate buckets per IP)
- Token bucket algorithm with configurable refill rates
- Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded
- Handles X-Forwarded-For for proxy/load balancer scenarios
- Thread-safe with ConcurrentHashMap

### 3. Integrated Filter into Security Chain
**File:** `src/main/java/edu/nu/owaspapivulnlab/config/SecurityConfig.java`

- Injected RateLimitingFilter via constructor
- Registered filter BEFORE JWT filter
- Ensures rate limits apply even to unauthenticated requests

## Security Benefits

### Before (Vulnerable)
```bash
# Attacker makes 1000 login attempts - ALL processed
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
    -d '{"username":"alice","password":"attempt'$i'"}'
done
# Result: Server processes all 1000 attempts
```

### After (Protected)
```bash
# Attacker makes 10 login attempts - only 5 allowed
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
    -d '{"username":"alice","password":"attempt'$i'"}'
done
# Result: 
# Attempts 1-5: Processed (401 Unauthorized)
# Attempts 6-10: {"error":"Too many requests. Please try again later.","status":429}
```

---

## Testing

### Quick Test
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Run the PowerShell test script:
   ```powershell
   .\test-rate-limiting.ps1
   ```

### Manual Testing

**Test Login Rate Limit (5/minute):**
```bash
# Attempt 1-5: Should process (even if credentials wrong)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"wrong"}'

# Attempt 6+: Should return 429
# Response: {"error":"Too many requests. Please try again later.","status":429}
```

**Test Signup Rate Limit (3/minute):**
```bash
# Attempt 1-3: Should create accounts
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"test1","password":"pass","email":"test1@example.com"}'

# Attempt 4+: Should return 429
```

**Verify Reset:**
Wait 60 seconds, then retry - should work again.

## Token Bucket Algorithm

How it works:
1. **Capacity:** Maximum tokens (requests) allowed
2. **Refill:** Tokens added back over time
3. **Consumption:** Each request takes 1 token
4. **Rejection:** No tokens = HTTP 429

**Example (Login - 5 tokens/minute):**
```
Time   Tokens  Action
00:00  5       ✓ Request 1 (4 remaining)
00:01  4       ✓ Request 2 (3 remaining)
00:02  3       ✓ Request 3 (2 remaining)
00:03  2       ✓ Request 4 (1 remaining)
00:04  1       ✓ Request 5 (0 remaining)
00:05  0       ✗ Request 6 (429 Too Many Requests)
01:00  5       Tokens refilled
01:01  4       ✓ Request 7 allowed
```

## Production Considerations

### 1. Distributed Deployments
Current: In-memory storage (single instance)
Production: Use Redis-backed buckets for multi-instance deployments

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.bucket4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>bucket4j-redis</artifactId>
  <version>8.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Monitoring
Add logging for rate limit events:
- Log 429 responses for security monitoring
- Alert on sustained high rate of 429s (potential attack)
- Track which endpoints are most frequently limited

### 3. Client Communication
Add rate limit headers:
```java
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 60
```

### 4. Tuning
Adjust limits based on:
- Actual usage patterns
- User feedback
- Performance requirements
- Business needs
